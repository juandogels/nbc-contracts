Accurate as of 01/01/2022

There are currently 6 rarities - common, uncommon, rare, epic, legendary, mythical.
The chances of obtaining each of them are as follows:

Common - 65%
Uncommon - 20%
Rare - 10%
Epic - 4%
Legendary - 0.9%
Mythical - 0.1%

Therefore, we base the rarity value off of 1000 points.

Common = 1-650
Uncommon = 651-850
Rare = 851-950
Epic = 951-990
Legendary = 991-999
Mythical = 1000

The results will be shown in the 1000 point basis from the blockchain but will be reflected with its actual rarity in-game.
This is to allow flexibility for changes in rarity from the blockchain side when minting NBMons.
