There is a small chance that an NBMon gets mutated, both from minting and from breeding.
If the chance is met, the NBMon will be randomized of the available mutation forms from its genus:

Let's say Lamox has 4 mutation types - red, orange, green and blue Lamox.
For instance, if I breed 2 Lamoxes and the offspring Lamox is mutated, the resulting mutation type will be any of the aforementioned colors.
The available movesets for mutated NBMons will be different in the game. Let's say a normal Lamox is a toxic and electric type. Red Lamox will allow
the availability of a special fire-type move in its moveset.

The current chance of mutation is:
1/1000 

If one parent is mutated, the chance increases to:
1/100

If both parents are mutated, the chance increases to:
1/10

Each genus has 4 mutation types possible, so mutation value will be:
0 - not mutated
1 to 4 - mutated; randomized
