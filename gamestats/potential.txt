The maximum Potential that an NBMon can obtain is 65 for each stat when minted.
Rarity DOES play a part for Potential by breeding.
Based on the current rarities from './rarity.txt':

1) For common, you can earn up to 20 Potential for origin and 15 for H + W (hybrid and wild)
2) For uncommon, you can earn up to 25 Potential for origin and 20 for H + W
3) For rare, you can earn up to 35 Potential for origin and 25 for H + W
4) For epic, you can earn up to 45 Potential for origin and 30 for H + W
5) For legendary, you can earn up to 55 Potential for origin and 40 for H + W
6) For mythical, you can earn up to 65 Potential for origin and 50 for H + W


These values will NOT be reflected from the raw blockchain data output when minted but ONLY in the marketplace/in-game.
So if you own a common NBMon that has 65 Potential, it will be counted as 65/65*20 = 20 in the marketplace/game.
