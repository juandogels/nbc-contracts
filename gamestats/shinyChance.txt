NBMonCore.sol has a _shinyChance variable that shows the values it can get.
For now, it is set at 4096, which means that the values can range from 1-4096.

The chance of obtaining a shiny NBMon is always set at 1/_shinyChance.
So, right now you have a 1/4096 chance of obtaining a shiny NBMon, or:

1 = shiny
2-4096 = not shiny
