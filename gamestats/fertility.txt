Currently an NBMon can have up to 3000 base fertility points.
Rarity plays a part into this. The higher the rarity of your NBMon, the lower fertility points you will lose when breeding.

The current standing for rarity to fertility point deduction relationship is:

Common - 1000 fertility points deducted each time it breeds (max 3 times)
Uncommon - 750 fertility points deducted each time it breeds (max 4 times)
Rare - 600 fertility points deducted each time it breeds (max 5 times)
Epic - 500 fertility points deducted each time it breeds (max 6 times)
Legendary - 375 fertility points deducted each time it breeds (max 8 times)
Mythical - 300 fertility points deducted each time it breeds (max 10 times)
